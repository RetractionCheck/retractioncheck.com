            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
              In the academic and research community, unintentional citation of retracted articles
              remains a significant concern. Studies have shown that many authors are unaware
              of the retraction status of the works they cite, leading to the propagation of invalid or
              flawed data. Although the Retraction Watch Database covers much of the
              retractions, there is no single repository encompassing all retracted publications.
              This issue is exacerbated by the fragmentation of retraction notifications and the lack
              of adequate information on the labelling of retractions across multiple publishing
              platforms and databases. To address this challenge, we have developed
              RetractionCheck, a free, non-profit service offering a federated search system that
              consolidates retraction data from various sources. Currently, our platform integrates
              publicly available APIs from the Retraction Watch Database (via CrossRef), PubMed,
              and Scopus.
              <br><br>
              We are actively seeking support and funding to incorporate additional APIs from Web
              of Science, PubPeer, and the full Scopus API, aiming to provide comprehensive
              coverage. Our user-friendly interface allows authors to upload and verify their
              reference lists in multiple formats, including BibTeX, IEEE, Chicago Manual of Style,
              MLA, and APA, ensuring compatibility with diverse citation management tools. By
              enabling researchers to cross-check their references efficiently, we strive to reduce
              the incidence of post-retraction citations, thereby enhancing the integrity of scholarly
              communication. We also advocate for integrating our service into peer review
              processes and editorial workflows as a proactive measure to identify and address
              retracted or questionable articles before publication. Through these efforts,
              RetractionCheck is committed to supporting the scientific community in maintaining
              rigorous research quality and trustworthiness standards.

            RetractionCheck aggregates retraction data from multiple trusted sources to ensure the
            veracity of scholarly references. Our platform integrates with various public and proprietary
            APIs to track retractions across disciplines. Below are the key data sources we utilize, along
            with their roles in retraction tracking and citation verification.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  The Retraction Watch Database (RWD) is a widely recognised repository that tracks
                  retracted papers across various disciplines. It provides in-depth information on academic
                  publications and reasons for their retraction. RetractionCheck uses RWD to cross-check
                  references and alert users about retracted articles. This allows researchers to quickly identify
                  problematic papers before citing them, even after generating a reference/works cited list.
                  Through its CrossRef API, RetractionCheck retrieves DOI metadata, retraction notices, and
                  related corrections issued by publishers. This ensures users can access verified, publisher-
                  provided retraction information, allowing for accurate citation management.                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  PubMed, maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), is a key resource for
                  biomedical literature. Its API provides retraction metadata for articles indexed in the PubMed
                  database, ensuring that researchers in medicine and life sciences can verify whether any cited
                  work has been retracted. By integrating the PubMed API, RetractionCheck helps prevent the
                  inadvertent citation of retracted biomedical research, which is especially critical in clinical
                  and biochemical studies.                </p>

                  Scopus is a widely used multidisciplinary database that provides extensive citation
                    data and bibliometric insights. At present, RetractionCheck is utilizing the Scopus
                    public API, which allows for basic data retrieval but has limitations in data-fetching
                    rates and metadata completeness. Due to these restrictions, some retraction
                    information may not always be fully accessible in our system. In the next phase, we
                    plan to integrate the full Scopus API, which will grant deeper citation tracking,
                    complete metadata access, and real-time retraction updates.

                  Web of Science is one of the most authoritative citation indexing databases, covering

                  metadata and robust retraction tracking, ensuring that researchers and publishers
